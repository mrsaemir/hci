# Summary: Understanding Interaction

---

## **1. Foundations of Interaction Design**
- **Key Principles**:
  - **Affordances**: What actions an object suggests (e.g., knobs afford turning).
  - **Visibility**: Make functionality obvious to the user.
  - **Feedback**: Provide immediate and clear responses to user actions.
  - **Mapping**: Ensure controls match their effects (e.g., spatial or cultural analogies).
  - **Constraints**: Limit user actions to prevent errors (physical, cultural, logical).
  - **Consistency**: Similar actions should behave similarly across the system.
  - **Metaphors**: Use familiar concepts to explain new systems (e.g., desktop metaphor).

---

## **2. Affordances**
- **Definition**: Properties of an object that suggest how it can be used (e.g., a chair affords sitting).
- **Examples**:
  - **Good**: A door handle that clearly indicates whether to push or pull.
  - **Bad**: A faucet with no visible controls or unclear operation.
- **Virtual Affordances**: In digital interfaces, perceived affordances (e.g., scrollbars) replace physical ones.

---

## **3. Visibility**
- **Importance**: Users should always know what actions are possible.
- **Examples**:
  - **Bad**: Elevator buttons with no visible feedback or instructions.
  - **Good**: Clear labels, flashing lights, or auditory cues to guide users.
- **Dark Patterns**: Intentionally hiding or misleading users (e.g., hidden fees in e-commerce).

---

## **4. Feedback**
- **Definition**: Immediate response to user actions (e.g., button clicks, animations).
- **Types**:
  - **Subtle**: For small, frequent actions (e.g., keypress feedback).
  - **Noticeable**: For major actions (e.g., saving a file).
- **Responsiveness**: Feedback should be fast (within 0.1s for perception, 1s for task completion).

---

## **5. Mapping**
- **Definition**: The relationship between controls and their effects.
- **Types**:
  - **Spatial**: Controls arranged like their real-world counterparts (e.g., light switches).
  - **Cultural**: Follow cultural conventions (e.g., left-to-right for Western cultures).
  - **Physical**: Follow real-world behavior (e.g., rising levels = more).
- **Example**: A thermostat with clear up/down buttons for temperature control.

---

## **6. Constraints**
- **Definition**: Limits that prevent user errors.
- **Types**:
  - **Physical**: Shape or placement limits actions (e.g., USB plug orientation).
  - **Cultural**: Cultural norms guide behavior (e.g., red = stop, green = go).
  - **Logical**: Common sense reasoning (e.g., all puzzle pieces must fit).
- **Example**: A form that prevents invalid input (e.g., letters in a numeric field).

---

## **7. Consistency**
- **Definition**: Similar actions should behave similarly across the system.
- **Types**:
  - **Internal**: Consistency within an application (e.g., consistent menu layouts).
  - **External**: Consistency across applications (e.g., Ctrl+C for copy).
- **Example**: Cut/Copy/Paste commands are consistent across most software.

---

## **8. Interface Metaphors**
- **Definition**: Using familiar concepts to explain new systems (e.g., desktop metaphor).
- **Benefits**:
  - Easier to learn and understand.
  - Helps users relate to unfamiliar systems.
- **Problems**:
  - Can limit creativity and innovation.
  - May not translate well across cultures.
- **Example**: The "recycle bin" metaphor for deleting files.

---

## **9. Interaction Types**
- **Instructing**: Giving commands (e.g., typing, selecting from menus).
  - **Example**: Vending machines, command-line interfaces.
- **Conversing**: Having a dialogue with the system (e.g., voice assistants like Siri).
  - **Example**: Chatbots, voice-controlled devices.
- **Manipulating**: Directly interacting with objects (e.g., dragging, zooming).
  - **Example**: Touchscreens, WYSIWYG editors.
- **Exploring**: Browsing and searching for information.
  - **Example**: Web browsing, digital libraries.

---

## **10. Analyzing Interfaces**
- **Example**: TiVo Remote Control
  - **Affordances**: Buttons afford pressing, but some functions are unclear.
  - **Visibility**: Important buttons are highlighted, but power/play buttons could be more visible.
  - **Feedback**: Physical feedback from buttons, but most feedback is on-screen.
  - **Mapping**: Direct mapping of buttons to functions, but some spatial mappings are unclear.
  - **Constraints**: Buttons are within thumb reach, but the remote can be held incorrectly.
  - **Consistency**: Internally consistent, but external consistency varies.
  - **Metaphors**: Play/forward/backward icons are metaphorical (from mechanical tapes).

---

## **11. Key Takeaways**
- **Good Design**: Leverages knowledge in the world, makes functionality visible, and provides clear feedback.
- **Bad Design**: Leads to user frustration, errors, and inefficiency.
- **Interaction Types**: Choose the right type (instructing, conversing, manipulating, exploring) based on the task and user needs.

### **Exam Tips**:
- Focus on understanding **affordances**, **visibility**, and **feedback**.
- Be able to analyze an interface using the **7 design principles**.
- Know the **4 interaction types** and when to use each.
