# Summary: Establishing Requirements in HCI

---

## **1. The Design Process**
- **Three Fundamental Activities**:
  1. **Understanding Requirements**: Identify what users need.
  2. **Producing a Design**: Create a solution that meets those needs.
  3. **Evaluating the Design**: Test the solution with users.

- **User Interface Design (UID)**:
  - A **multi-faceted process** involving problem-solving, creativity, and decision-making.
  - **Interdisciplinary**: Involves designers, engineers, psychologists, and domain experts.

---

## **2. Approaches to UID**
- **User-Centered Design**: Focuses on users' needs and goals.
- **Activity-Centered Design**: Focuses on tasks and behaviors.
- **System Design**: Considers the entire ecosystem of use (people, tools, devices).
- **Genius Design**: Relies on the designer’s expertise and creativity.

- **In Practice**: Most design processes combine these approaches.

---

## **3. User-Centered Design (UCD)**
- **Key Principles**:
  1. **Early Focus on Users**: Observe users and involve them in the design process.
  2. **Empirical Measurement**: Test prototypes with real users.
  3. **Iterative Design**: Continuously refine the design based on feedback.

- **Why Involve Users?**:
  - **Functionality**: Ensures the product meets user needs.
  - **Expectation Management**: Aligns user expectations with the final product.
  - **Ownership**: Users are more likely to accept and support the product.

## **4. The Design Process**
- **Waterfall Model (Wrong Way)**:
  - Linear process (requirements → design → code → test) often misses user needs.
- **Iterative Design (Right Way)**:
  - **Requirements**: Identify usability and user experience goals.
  - **Design**: Create concepts, mockups, and wireframes.
  - **Prototyping**: Build prototypes of varying fidelity.
  - **Evaluation**: Test prototypes with real users and refine.

- **Danger of Iterations**: Risk of getting stuck in local maxima (improving a bad design).

## **5. Involving Users**
- **IDEO’s Process**:
  1. Understand the market, client, and technology.
  2. Observe real users in real-life situations.
  3. Visualize new concepts and prototypes.
  4. Evaluate and refine prototypes.
  5. Implement the final design.

- **Microsoft’s Process**:
  - Feature selection based on user observations.
  - Usability testing with 10 users for each feature.
  - Beta testing with selected customers before release.

---

## **6. Types of Requirements**
- **Functional**: What the system should do (e.g., features, tasks).
- **Non-Functional**: Constraints (e.g., response time, form factor).
- **Data**: What data needs to be stored and how.
- **Users**: Characteristics, abilities, and system use (novice, expert, casual).
- **Environment**: Physical, social, organizational, and technical context.

---

## **7. Understanding the Problem Space**
- **Key Questions**:
  1. **Why develop the system?** Understand the problem and goals.
  2. **Who are the users?** Identify primary, secondary, and tertiary users.
  3. **What do they want to do?** Analyze tasks and needs.

- **Outcomes**:
  - **Situation of Concern**: Brief description of the main goal and constraints.
  - **Problem Statement**: Concise description of the intended solution.

---

## **8. Who Are the Users?**
- **Primary Users**: Frequent, hands-on users.
- **Secondary Users**: Occasional users or those who interact indirectly.
- **Tertiary Users**: Affected by the system but do not directly use it.
- **Stakeholders**: Anyone affected by or influencing the system (e.g., managers, customers, suppliers).

---

## **9. Personas**
- **Definition**: Fictional characters representing user groups.
- **Elements**:
  - Name, job title, demographics, goals, tasks, environment, and a quote.
- **Benefits**:
  - Helps designers understand user needs and goals.
  - Informs functionality and uncovers gaps.
- **How Many?** 3-5 personas per project, focusing on major user groups.

---

## **10. Task Analysis**
- **Goal**: Understand what users are trying to achieve and how they currently do it.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Gather Data**: Observe and interview users.
  2. **Analyze Data**: Structure and prioritize findings.
  3. **Extract Requirements**: Model requirements based on user needs.

- **Techniques**:
  - **Scenarios**: Informal narratives describing user tasks.
  - **Use Cases**: Detailed descriptions of user-system interactions.
  - **Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)**: Breaks tasks into subtasks.

---

## **11. Key Takeaways**
- **Requirements are crucial**: Getting them right saves time and money.
- **Involve users early and often**: Ensures the product meets real needs.
- **Use personas and task analysis**: To understand users and their tasks.
- **Iterative design**: Continuously refine the design based on user feedback.

---

### **Exam Tips**:
- Focus on understanding **user-centered design principles**.
- Be able to explain **personas** and how they inform design.
- Know the difference between **functional** and **non-functional requirements**.
- Understand **task analysis techniques** like scenarios, use cases, and HTA.
