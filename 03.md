# Summary: Cognitive Aspects in HCI

---

## **1. Cognition**
- **Definition**: The mental process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.
- **Key Cognitive Processes**:
  - **Perception**: Recognizing and interpreting sensory stimuli.
  - **Attention**: Focusing on specific stimuli.
  - **Memory**: Storing and recalling information.
  - **Problem-solving**: Making decisions and planning actions.

## **2. Perception**
- **Definition**: The process of recognizing and interpreting sensory stimuli (visual, auditory, tactile, etc.).
- **Visual Perception**:
  - **Foveal Vision**: Central, focused vision (5-18° field of view).
  - **Peripheral Vision**: Blurred vision in the outer field of view, used for detecting movement and brightness changes.
  - **Saccadic Movements**: Rapid eye movements during reading or scanning.
  - **Gestalt Laws**: Principles that explain how humans perceive visual elements as whole forms (e.g., proximity, similarity, closure).

- **Auditory Perception**:
  - Humans can hear frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz, with peak sensitivity between 1-4 kHz.
  - **Loudness**: Subjective perception of sound intensity (measured in phon).
  - **Pitch**: Perception of sound frequency (measured in Hz).

- **Tactile Perception**:
  - **Mechanoreceptors**: Sensory cells that detect pressure, vibration, and touch (e.g., Merkel’s disks, Pacinian corpuscles).
  - **Sensitivity**: Varies across the body (e.g., fingertips are more sensitive than the back).

## **3. Memory**
- **Types of Memory**:
  - **Sensory Memory**: Brief recall of sensory experiences (0.2-1.5 seconds).
  - **Working Memory**: Limited capacity (4-7 chunks of information), holds data for ~15 seconds.
  - **Long-term Memory**: Almost infinite capacity, stores information for long periods.

- **Design Implications**:
  - **Recognition over Recall**: Use menus, icons, and visual cues to reduce memory load.
  - **Chunking**: Group information into smaller, meaningful units to aid memory.

## **4. Motor System**
- **Fitts’ Law**: Predicts the time required for aimed movements (e.g., clicking a button).
  - Formula: `t = a + b * log2(D/W)`
    - `t`: Time to select the target.
    - `D`: Distance to the target.
    - `W`: Width of the target.
  - **Implications**:
    - Place frequently used elements closer to the user or make them larger.
    - Use screen edges and corners for important elements (infinite width).

## **5. Cognitive Models for HCI**
- **Mental Models**:
  - Users form internal representations of how a system works.
  - **Example**: Thermostats (users often misunderstand how they work).
  - **Goal**: Align the user’s mental model with the designer’s conceptual model.

- **Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation**:
  - **Gulf of Execution**: The gap between user intentions and system actions.
  - **Gulf of Evaluation**: The gap between system feedback and user understanding.
  - **Goal**: Bridge these gulfs to reduce cognitive effort.

- **Human Processor Model**:
  - Models cognitive activity as information processing stages (perception, memory, motor response).
  - Predicts task completion time based on cognitive processes.

- **External Cognition**:
  - Cognition is not just internal; it relies on external tools and representations (e.g., to-do lists, calculators).
  - **Forms**:
    - **Externalizing**: Offloading memory to external tools (e.g., calendars).
    - **Computational Offloading**: Using external tools to solve problems (e.g., pen and paper for math).
    - **Annotating**: Modifying external representations to aid cognition (e.g., crossing off tasks).

## **6. Design Implications**
- **Perception**:
  - Use **Gestalt laws** to group information intuitively.
  - Make important elements stand out (e.g., color, spacing).
  - Avoid cluttering the interface with too much information.
- **Memory**:
  - Support **recognition** over recall (e.g., menus, icons).
  - Provide **feedback** to confirm user actions.
- **Motor System**:
  - Apply **Fitts’ Law** to optimize the placement and size of UI elements.
  - Use **large targets** for frequently used actions.
- **Cognitive Models**:
  - Align the **user’s mental model** with the system’s conceptual model.
  - Bridge the **gulfs of execution and evaluation** to reduce cognitive effort.

### **Exam Tips**:
- Focus on understanding **Fitts’ Law** and its implications for UI design.
- Be able to explain **Gestalt laws** and how they apply to visual perception.
- Understand the differences between **sensory memory**, **working memory**, and **long-term memory**.
- Know how **mental models** and **external cognition** influence user interaction.
